# Artefact

An urn containing Nettlau's ashes, the only object in the whole archive which really differs from other artifacts, since it carries inside the real person and its closely connected to history of the archive itself. The artifact which should be questioned, after all, it might be misinterpreted and misunderstood. It touches on topics of ethics, morality, honor, history, human being and social patterns.

# Research

The reason why I chose to transcode this specific object, which is not always attractive for many people, starts with questioning the archive itself. At the beginning of my research at IISG, I was wondering if there is something by mistake, something that doesn't necessarily belong there. Because I couldn't question this by myself, I asked people who work there for advice and at that moment I got to Max Nettau.

## Nettlau's identity

<a name="2.1.1"></a>
## Max

Max Heinrich Hermann Reinhardt Nettlau was a German anarchist and historian, born on **30 April 1865 in Neuwaldegg (Austria) in a well-to-do family**. He was also known as the *'Herodotus of Anarchy'*, the first and greatest historian of the anarchist movement. But Max Nettlau himself detested such honored accolades. Unlike the *Wichtigmacher*, he preferred the humble and marginal phenomena that are on the verge of disappearing. He wrote his PhD on **Celtic languages, Welsh** in particular, and as an amateur **bird-watcher,** he thoroughly researched the species of the tiny siskin.

His father, a prince's court gardener, **taught him to love nature.** Nettlau became a student of philology and specialized in Welsh, which brought him to the British Museum. In 1887 he obtained his doctorate with a thesis called *Beiträge zur cymrischen Grammatik*. Even as a child, Nettlau noted in his memoirs, he 'somehow considered the supporter of any government system as a seriously defective person'. As a student, he became interested in socialism, and in London, he became a member of the Socialist League, the only organization he was ever to join. Nettlau regarded himself as an **anarchist-communist amidst socialists of various national and denominational backgrounds**. He began to write articles for John Most's *Freiheit*, and he befriended famous anarchists like **Peter Kropotkin, Elisée Reclus, and Errico Malatesta.**

In the 1890s realising that a generation of socialist and anarchist militants from the mid-19th century was passing away and their archives of writings and correspondence being destroyed, **he concentrated his effort and a recent modest inheritance from his father on acquiring and rescuing such collections from destruction**. He also made many interviews of veteran militants for posterity. He wrote biographies of many famous anarchists, including **Mikhail Bakunin, Élisée Reclus, and Errico Malatesta**. He also wrote a seven volume history of anarchism. He lived continuously in Amsterdam from 1938 where he worked on cataloging the archive for the Institute. ***He died there suddenly from stomach cancer in 1944, without ever being harassed.***

### Bakunin

In 1892, a considerable inheritance enabled Nettlau to start research on the patriarch of anarchism, Michail Bakunin. He traveled throughout Europe to interview people who had known Bakunin (1814-1876) personally and to collect materials. This resulted in a three-volume biography (1896-1900) and many subsequent publications on Bakunin. Fifty copies of the biography were *'auto copied'* by Nettlau himself on the precursor of the mimeograph. He later described his Bakunin biography as a *'piece of furniture which I sent to some people's home address but they had no room for it ... I gave it as a present to libraries and the majority stocked it properly, but probably it has disappeared from the shelves, in some cases just as well...'* At the same time Nettlau compiled a *Bibliographie de l'Anarchie* (Brussels 1897). Another voluminous work of his, *Geschichte der Anarchie* [History of Anarchism] was published in phases: the three first volumes came out from 1925 to 1931, three others during the 1980s, and the remaining volumes have yet to be published. Characteristically, Nettlau did not bother to promote this work, which is still an authoritative history of anarchist ideas. Many smaller contributions by Nettlau were published, mainly in *Freedom*.

### The siskin

Max is also an amateur bird-watcher he thoroughly researched the species of the tiny siskin. His interest in the tiny siskin began to grow at the beginning of the twentieth century. Possibly there is a connection with the untimely death of his fiancée, Therese Bognar, in 1907. Only a small number of his friends knew about her. In general Nettlau hardly spoke about personal matters at all. From 1907 to 1920 he would write his diary in the form of letters to his deceased fiancée.

Back in the British Museum he scrutinized and inventoried the fifty species and subspecies of the siskin worldwide. The plumage of one particular siskin in South America had his special attention. Nettlau memorized these explorations into the world of animals, for they 'showed him the uselessness of stereotypical explanations, no matter whether they were from Marx, the Darwinians, or Kropotkin'.

Nettlau hated training animals and he pitied timid circus lions equally with fleas in flea circuses. There is probably a parallel here in his rejection of Leninism and Stalinism, the hair-splitting and fanaticism among Marxists. Nettlau preferred to make people feel personally responsible in an ethical sense. 'Anyone who fails to liberate himself spiritually and morally can only expect to fall victim to submission one way or another.'

## IISG = Nettlau

**The name of the International Institute of Social History (1935) very nearly was the 'Max Nettlau Institute'.** Most of all he collected documents on social history, preferably *not* the general surveys and monographs, but rather the handouts, pamphlets, bulletins, and papers from the social movements themselves. At the end of his life, Nettlau, with [his enormous collection of archives and printed materials](http://www.iisg.nl/archives/en/files/n/10765475.php), brought the Institute into blossom. His extensive collection or archives was sold to the [International Institute of Social History](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Institute_of_Social_History) in [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam) in 1935.

All his life Nettlau combed **through bookstalls, antiquarian bookshops, and private collections in search of special documents.** He set himself the task of purchasing at least a thousand items a month. This is how he described his acquisitions policy in 1920: *'I noticed how often libraries purchase general surveys about particular subjects and how any serious research is bound to have endless gaps; how pamphlets, periodicals, and collections of flyers tend to disappear or become dispersed and can only be partially reconstructed with great difficulty. This does not count manuscripts, letters and other material, or oral traditions of short duration. For this reason I tried to collect these rare materials from the beginning....'* Unknowingly, Nettlau defined the acquisitions policy of the IISH up to the present.

The First World War and the inflation that followed nearly reduced Nettlau to penury. **Parts of his collection had been stored in various depositories, and this cost money that he did not have.** Nettlau searched for a proper library that would shelter his collection, but various initiatives ran aground. In 1935 the librarian of the IISH, **Annie Adama van Scheltema,** tactfully drew up a **contract with him.** Finally Nettlau was able to buy **the coal heater** he so badly needed, whereas the Institute now **owned the largest collection on anarchism in the world**, as well as many other fine materials.

In 1938, when the Anschluss took place in Austria, Nettlau happened to be in Amsterdam and he decided to stay there. **He was pleased to work on describing his own collection and other relevant archives.** The Nettlau collection filled three large classrooms at the IISH. Sadly, though, he had to witness the occupation of the Institute and the transport of his collection by the Nazis to the East. **He did not live to see the return of his papers after the war, as he died on 23 July 1944.**

After his death his private papers came to the IISH_

# Afterlife

The reason why Nettlau's ashes are in the IISG will stay unknown. First I have been told that he didn't have any close relatives anymore, so they weren't sure what to do with him and since he was so closely connected to archive, they archived him there together with the rest of his personal archive. But then I researched that his ashes were deposited at the IISH in the 1970s decades after his death, this might be connected to the politics and the complexity of this specific collection.

In individualist cultures, death symbolises an abrupt disruption – the end of life, whereas according to clinical criteria it signifies the irreversible cessation of all vital functions
of an organism, marking the inescapable final stage of individual existence. In
many cultures, death is perceived as a transition from one state of being to
another, an intermediary stage in the endless process of transformations and
alterations.

Later in my research I started to look at him as he would be alive in the archive.

## Human ashes

An average human body takes from two to three hours to burn completely and will produce an average of **3 to 9 pounds of ash**. The amount of ash depends on the bone structure of the human body and not so much on their weight.

Cremation urn capacity is also measured in cubic inches. Most standard adult urns have a capacity of **200 cubic inches,** while "*companion urns,*" which are designed for two people, generally have a capacity of **400 cubic inches.**

Cremation ashes are made of **crushed bone fragments.** The cremation process applies extreme heat (1500-1800 degrees Fahrenheit) to the decedent's body, incinerating everything except the bones. Once the cremation chamber cools down, the bones are removed from the retort and pulverized. The resulting material is sometimes called "ash" but in reality is more like a **coarse, pebbly sand.**

# Transcoding

When we rethink the meaning of archiving the real human remains in the institute, we could question the **necessity to keep him there**. In his honor and for his inner afterlife peace, I want to **recreate his identity through the pieces which I found in the archive**. I want to create for him the **digital archive of himself,** help him to get **scattered** somehow, and get **free** from the archive at least in the digital world. So I'm designing something like an **online library of the pieces** of his identity. I try to approach this topic in different ways, but using the same tools. **Capturing** his abstract existance and **collecting** small fragments together.

Same as the ash, my library is formed by **small fragments**, which doesn't mean so much separately, but together it's one whole - his identity. The library could be interpreted as a different world, where we can observe him **within time and place limitations.** Because I think it's impossible to capture the whole life of an individual I want to **scatter the information separately** **as a symbol of release and freedom**. If we would consider the religion and ethics we could say that he is locked and framed there, almost living his afterlife...

The nonlinear narrative of this project makes this project about the **reconstruction of something unknown and the intended reduction of the whole.** The remains by itself is a very fragile object, same as **the knowledge of the past**. By retelling at least a part of his story we get further to the core of his current existence which I think its the main thing that I'm transcoding.

I was also considering the recreation of the ash itself, what would be more like an encoding than transcoding though, so I have decided to work with the chemical components as with the **ingredients**, and design a recipe on how to **recreate your own human remains** at home.

In general, in the archive, the objects are becoming sacred, we are giving them **extra time to live, to be seen, to be remembered.** In fact his existence is extended (at this point almost 80 years), I want to go further to memorialize his character through **abstract storytelling. Retelling the same story different ways.**

## Transcoding No. 1

### Images as fragments

Combining and sorting his photographs to images as a symbol of ashes to scatter his remains, the using his extensive photo collection, including his personal photographs and shot of him even death. Can we visualize this character and recreate it from his remains? How would he look during the ceremony? As in real life, we can not see where the ashes are exactly on the ground, in the same way, I don't want to point at one direction, but more design this archive of images which can be translated as the act, the process of scattering. The meaning is more important than the object, so it's not fundamental to look at the images as to pieces which form one whole.

### Methods

Adopting image manipulation through Processing using the collected photographs. Specifically using two codes, the first one to apply pixel sorting which visualizes the scattering and touches more the mood of something disappearing, going away.

<details>
  <summary>Part of the ASDF Pixel sorting code by Kim Asendorf</summary>
  <br />

     sorting modes
     0 = black
     1 = brightness
     2 = white

    int mode = 1;

    // image path is relative to sketch directory
    PImage img;
    String imgFileName = "Portrait";
    String fileType = "jpeg";

    int loops = 1;

    // threshold values to determine sorting start and end pixels
    int blackValue = -16000000;
    int brightnessValue = 60;
    int whiteValue = -13000000;

    int row = 0;
    int column = 0;

    boolean saved = false;

    void setup() {
      img = loadImage(imgFileName+"."+fileType);

      // use only numbers (not variables) for the size() command, Processing 3
      size(1, 1);

      // allow resize and update surface to image dimensions
      surface.setResizable(true);
      surface.setSize(img.width, img.height);

      // load image onto surface - scale to the available width,height for display
      image(img, 0, 0, width, height);
    }

    void draw() {

      // loop through columns
      while(column < img.width-1) {
        println("Sorting Column " + column);
        img.loadPixels();
        sortColumn();
        column++;
        img.updatePixels();
      }

      // loop through rows
      while(row < img.height-1) {
        println("Sorting Row " + column);
        img.loadPixels();
        sortRow();
        row++;
        img.updatePixels();
      }

</details>
The second code randomise the selection and combines two already sorted images.

<details>
  <summary>Part of the blending code</summary>

  <br />

    void setup() {
      size(800, 800);
      frameRate(1);

      // Initialize arrays
      folder = new java.io.File(sketchPath("data"));
      filenames = folder.list();
      imgs = new PImage[filenames.length];

      // Populate image array with all images from the data folder
      // There should only be images in the folder, or it will throw an error!
      // A hidden .DS_STORE file (on a Mac) will let this fail for example

      for(int i = 0; i < filenames.length; i++) {
        imgs[i] = loadImage(filenames[i]);    
        // Optional: resize image (leave one argument as 0 to resize proportionally)
        //imgs[i].resize(width, 0);
      }

    }

    void draw() {
      // Pick two random indexes, aka which item we want to pick from the images array
      int randomIndex0 = int(random(filenames.length));
      int randomIndex1 = int(random(filenames.length));

      // Blend two images together using a custom function which accepts two parameters
      blendImages(imgs[randomIndex0], imgs[randomIndex1]);

      // Optional: save frame
      saveFrame("###.jpg");
    }

</details>
The connection between those two specific photographs leads us to an abstract story, where we look at his life at different times to more understand what kind of person he was.

Various approach to code so I got really different results.

## Transcoding No.2

### Words hidden in images

Max Nettlau published during his life many papers, I went through a few of them and I selected text which seemed to be relevant. I want to find another way to tell a short story about Nettlau, for that I'm using the text inside of the abstract image. Basically it's something like extending the text format of the image, as another way of scattering his pieces. The visuals and the text influence each other, depend on each other and again making sense together more than separately. For example, can hide manifesto or part from anarchist paper.

### Methods

Reusing the "trash" from transcoding no.1, already scattered Nettlau carrying the text inside. Rewriting the text format of manipulated image.

### Tools

Processing code, textEdit

## Transcoding No. 3

### Chemical encoding

A recipe of how to recreate human ash at home from everyday objects. Purely looking at the object and trying to think how can I make it more resilient, thereafter the consideration of the fragility of the remains, we should be able to recreate it whenever we need the ash for something. In my opinion, it's not crucial to store the real ash, after some time it becomes just the symbol that can be easily replaced.

### Methods

To get some results in this case we need just the recipe. The rest is the viewer doing individually by himself. First I researched the chemical components of human ash, then I continued with research on where we can find those components (see previous research). The visual of the recipe is connected with the first transcoding.

### Tools

Adobe package + if using the images from first sorting then also Processing

### Results

To make human ash I need: *baking powder, chalk, dry toothpaste, dry banana, fertilizer, sea salt, clay, aluminum foil, magnesium pill, drop of blood, inside of batteries, dry paint, rat poison (poison in general), polish for metal*

## Transcoding No. 4

### Dialog from our meeting

A poem about escaping the archive. Imagine you meet a person who is trapped in an urn for the last 80 years, what kind of conversation would you have with him? What do you want to tell to us? The main focus on frustration, fear to be trapped, being locked, and not able to go anywhere.  The urgency of release.

### Methods

Rethinking the human interactions within the life situation. Constructing the identity just based on my own experience, and imagination. Very free approach, using sarcasm, metaphors, rhymes.

### Results

Experiencing the escape.

The short abstract video of him transforming, as the symbol of finally getting peace and disappearing from the archive since he is finally feeling scattered, accompanied by the sounds of siskin because he was such a big fan of this bird.


### Methods

Displaying the transition of the images before and after to retell the story of Nettlau again, looking at his life after the whole research what I have done, I think of release.

### Tools

Processing, Premiere pro

### Website invisible library

To be able to spread the pieces of Nettlau and scatter him digitally, I have decided to create a website where you can download the transcoded material. One by one, randomized and scattered, image library.

(The library could be interpreted as a different world, where we can observe him **within time and place limitations.** Because I think it's impossible to capture the whole life of an individual I want to **scatter the information separately** **as a symbol of release and freedom**. If we would consider the religion and ethics we could say that he is locked and framed there, almost living his afterlife... )

Since the visitor is seing only one picture I also coded one more website which is more like overview of **his digital ashes.**

### Aims

The aim is to spread the information to be able to scatter him. Same as the ash, the library is formed by **small fragments**, which doesn't mean so much separately, but together it's one whole - his identity. Reconstruction of a person from small pieces of information or visuals.

### Methods

Part of the js code for first website:

<details>
  <summary>JS code</summary>

    ```jsx
    const downloadFile = function(uri, name) {
    var link = document.createElement("button");
    link.type = 'button';
    link.onclick = window.open(uri);
    link.click();
    }

    downloadFile(downloadFiles[Math.ceil(Math.random() * downloadFiles.length)], "1");

    ```

    ```jsx
    const downloadFiles = ["./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/1 1.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/001_copy_2.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/001_copy.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/1.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/001.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/0001.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/002 1.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/002 2.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/002_copy.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/2.jpg",       
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/002.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/0002.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/00002.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/3.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/003.jpg",
    "./Nettlaus ashes transcoding/0003.jpg"]

    ```

</details>

For the overview I used php (for the first time), I used it to be able just create grid with the pictures from the folder to make the html code easier:

<details>
  <summary>Part of the php code</summary>

  ```jsx
  <ul>
  	<?php
  		$dirname = "Nettlaus ashes transcoding/";
  		$images = scandir($dirname);
  		shuffle($images);
  		$ignore = array(".", "..");
  		foreach($images as $curimg){
  			if(!in_array($curimg, $ignore)) {
  				echo "<li><a href=\"$dirname$curimg\"><img src='img.php?src=$dirname$curimg&w=300&zc=1' alt='' /></a></li>\n ";
  			}
  		}
  	?>
  </ul>

  ```

</details>

Then I also used code by Mindshare Studios, see links. The code reads the images from the folder and randomise them on grid, so if I want I can add some images with the time without changing the code.

(Adopting image manipulation through Processing using the collected photographs. Specifically using two codes, the first one to apply pixel sorting which visualizes the scattering and touches more the mood of something disappearing, going away.

<details>
  <summary>Sort Image By Npx</summary>

  ```jsx
  // threshold values to determine sorting start and end pixels
  int blackValue = -16000000;
  int brightnessValue = 60;
  int whiteValue = -13000000;
  int row = 0;
  int column = 0;
  boolean saved = false;
  void setup() {
    img = loadImage(imgFileName+"."+fileType);
    // use only numbers (not variables) for the size() command, Processing 3
    size(1, 1);
    // allow resize and update surface to image dimensions
    surface.setResizable(true);
    surface.setSize(img.width, img.height);
    // load image onto surface - scale to the available width,height for display
    image(img, 0, 0, width, height);
  }
  void draw() {
    // loop through columns
    while(column < img.width-1) {
      println("Sorting Column " + column);
      img.loadPixels();
      sortColumn();
      column++;
      img.updatePixels();
    }
    // loop through rows
    while(row < img.height-1) {
      println("Sorting Row " + column);
      img.loadPixels();
      sortRow();
      row++;
      img.updatePixels();
    }
    // load updated image onto surface and scale to fit the display width,height
    image(img, 0, 0, width, height);
    if(!saved && frameCount >= loops) {

The second code randomise the selection and combines two already sorted images.

<details>
  <summary>Part of the blending data code:</summary>

  ```jsx
  // Custom function which takes two parameters of type 'PImage'
    void blendImages(PImage img0, PImage img1) {
      for (int i = 0; i < width; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < height; j++) {
          // Create temporary variables x and y (we could also just use i and j)
          int x = i;
          int y = j;
          // Create variable of type color and set to black
          color col = color(0);
          // Create two variables of type color which contain the current pixel color value
          color c0 = img0.get(x, y);
          color c1 = img1.get(x, y);
          // Decide what value the variable 'col' should be
          if (brightness(c0) > brightness(c1)) {
            col = c0;
          } else {
            col = c1;
          }
          // Set the pixel at position x, y to the value of color variable 'col'
          set(x, y, col);
        }
      }
    }
  ```

The connection between those two specific photographs leads us to an abstract story, where we look at his life at different times to more understand what kind of person he was.

Various approach to code so I got really different results.

# Reflection

I really enjoyed the image manipulation. A purely digital outcome that wasn't intended but then the concept evolved in such a way that it wouldn't make sense anymore. Rethinking the story narration and story telling.
